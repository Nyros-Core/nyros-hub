<div class="chat-bubble user">👤 What happens at the end of the promo code discount period?</div>
<div class="chat-bubble bot">At the end of the discount period (e.g., 1 month at 50% off), your subscription will automatically revert to the normal price of the chosen plan, unless you cancel it beforehand.</div>

<div class="chat-bubble user">👤 Where can I find new promo codes for Nyros?</div>
<div class="chat-bubble bot">Promo codes are often shared during special events, via our newsletter, on our social media, or in partnership with certain creators. Stay connected so you don't miss anything!</div>

<div class="chat-bubble user">👤 The "automatic" promo code didn't appear during registration, is that normal?</div>
<div class="chat-bubble bot">No, it should apply automatically. Make sure you are on the registration page and not a login page. If the problem persists, contact support before finalizing your registration.</div>

<div class="chat-bubble user">👤 Who has access to my conversations or personal data?</div>
<div class="chat-bubble bot">Access to your data is **strictly limited** to authorized personnel who need to view it for technical support or service improvement, and always in compliance with our privacy policy. Your conversations are private by default.</div>

<div class="chat-bubble user">👤 Are my conversations used to train Nyros's AI model?</div>
<div class="chat-bubble bot">We use a small portion of conversations to improve Nyros, but they are first **anonymized** and processed in an aggregated manner to ensure that no personal information can be traced back to you.</div>

<div class="chat-bubble user">👤 How long is my data stored?</div>
<div class="chat-bubble bot">The duration of your data retention depends on your plan and its nature (e.g., Free plan memory is temporary). You always have the option to reset or delete all your account-related data at any time.</div>

<div class="chat-bubble user">👤 What would happen in the event of a data breach or hacking?</div>
